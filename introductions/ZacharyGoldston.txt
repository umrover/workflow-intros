Name: Zachary Goldston
Pronouns: he/him/his
Year: Senior
Major: CSE

This is my fourth year on MRover's Software Branch. I've done multiple ULCS courses, and have a wide variety of softare engineering internship experiences, ranging from embedded work to full-stack design. I'm the most comfortable with C/C++ or Java, but I also have experience with Python, JavaScript/Angular, TypeScript, Rust, and OCaml.

Outside of rover, I am an IA for EECS 280, an active member of Tau Beta Pi, a cellist, and a member of a few other CSE or Math focused groups. I enjoy playing golf, skiing, cooking, and trying new bars or restaurants. Feel free to ask me about classes, applying to/experiencing internships, hobbies, or pretty much most things!
