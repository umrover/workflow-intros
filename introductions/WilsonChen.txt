Name: Wilson Chen
Pronouns: He/him
Year: Junior
Major: Computer Engineering

I started programming in high school and have taken EECS 280, 281, and currently taking 370.
I have experience in Java, C/C++, Python and I do not like euchre.

Outside of school/MRover, I play a lot of different games and watch the Urban Rescue Ranch channel on youtube (go watch it!!).
I love following computer hardware prices and thinking of good builds. Let me know good builds for under $1000!
