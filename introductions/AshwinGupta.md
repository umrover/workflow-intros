**Senior, CSE**

This is my third year on rover. Outside of rover, I'm an undergraduate researcher in the ARM Robotics Lab where I work on visibility-aware visual servoing methods. Last summer I interned at Anduril, a defense company that builds counter-unmanned air systems (cUAS) technology. I developed motion planning and control software for a cUAS drone. 

I do most of my programming in Python and C++. I'm a huge fan of numpy and vectorized code paradigms in general. I also have done quite a bit of GPGPU computing with CUDA. Recently I've been using Rust and I think its an awesome language. Going forward I'll be writing all my systems software in Rust whenever possible.

Some other things I like include football, watching movies, and indoor plants. I am also interested in philosophy and politics.
