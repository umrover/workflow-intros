This is my third year on MRover's Software Branch. I've taken multiple ULCS courses and completed a few different software engineering internships. I'm most comfortable with C++, but also have experience in Python, Vue/JavaScript, and Java.

Outside of school and rover, I'm heavily involved and the marching band -- I play alto sax and work on band-related service projects. When I have time, I also like to read historical fiction, run, and play sports (not very competitively) with friends. Feel free to talk to me about any of that stuff, classes/internships, or city planning!
