Wilson Merritt, he/him/his, freshman, Computer Engineering

I took AP Computer Science in high school, so I have some background in java. I am also familiar with a little bit of python through my own coding ventures, and have aa tiny bit of experience coding in C++. 

Outside of school, I enjoy going to the gym, hanging out with friends, and playing video games. I also like to go to the football games, and am a Cincinnati Bengals fan on Sundays.
