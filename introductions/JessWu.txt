Name: Jess Wu
Pronouns: He/Him
Year: Freshman
Major: Computer Science

I have done programming for FRC and FTC. Very little actual academic 
experience since I was mostly self taught (probably amounted to some very bad
programming habits)

I enjoy playing a few games (Destiny 2 being the current unhealthy addiction).
I also enjoy watching anime(Your Name is a 10/10 and you can't convince me otherwise
and playing card games (Learned how to play Euchre my first day here).
