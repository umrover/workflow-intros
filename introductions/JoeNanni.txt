    This is my third year as a member of the rover teleop team. For the past two summers I have interned for Michigan Medicine working on project 
involving large datasets from the School of Anesthesiology. My programming includes lots of C++ from class projects, Python, and several different web
frameworks like Vue, React, and Angular. In my free time I enjoy Tennis, skateboarding (ask me about the skate club!), video games, and trying new restaurants/cooking new things. I also 
very recently got into disc golf! Ask me anything about classes, jobs/internships, my hobbies, or pretty much anything else.
